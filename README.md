# README
Example demo for the original Gameboy (DMG-01) in assembly.

First of all, kudos to David Pello. I just following his great tutorial ([Spanish version here](http://wiki.ladecadence.net/doku.php?id=tutorial_de_ensamblador)).

I will eventually update this readme file to include how to run this, but until that if you can read Spanish (as me as an Uruguayan) I encourage you to follow his wiki.

I'll expand this example with more commits.
